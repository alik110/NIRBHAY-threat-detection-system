3. **Monitor Outputs**: The system will display real-time detection results on the screen. Detected threats will be highlighted.

### Example Command
```bash
python main.py --source webcam
```

## Telegram Alerts

NIRBHAY can send alerts directly to your Telegram account when a threat is detected. To set this up:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**:
   - Open Telegram and search for the BotFather.
   - Create a new bot and note down the API token.

2. **Get Your Chat ID**:
   - Start a chat with your bot and send any message.
   - Use the following URL to get your chat ID:
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for your chat ID in the JSON response.

3. **Configure Alerts**:
   - Open the `config.py` file in the project directory.
   - Add your bot token and chat ID:
     ```python
     TELEGRAM_TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'
     CHAT_ID = 'YOUR_CHAT_ID'
     ```

4. **Enable Alerts**:
   - In the `main.py` file, ensure the alert feature is enabled:
     ```python
     send_alerts = True
     ```

Now, NIRBHAY will send alerts to your Telegram whenever it detects a threat.
